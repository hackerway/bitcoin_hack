9353159,PBmining,"Thanks guys, we have been getting very positive feedback during our first couple days! &nbsp;<br /><br />We have also received a few requests to eliminate the buyer restrictions, so we have gone ahead and put some new auctions up on Ebay.<br /><br />http://www.ebay.com/usr/pbmining<br /><br />Congratulations to ebay user sokaris91, who managed to steal a total of 800MH/s for $2.25!!!!<br /><br /><br /><br />EDIT: Still experiencing technical problems with my listings.&nbsp; Talking to Ebay again to have those buyer restrictions removed."

9243170,ajw7989,how do we purchase the 5 year mining contracts for .016 bitcoin. I am definitely interested in this.

9243172,PBmining,Looks like our web host (Arvixe) is having their first &quot;hiccup&quot; with us.&nbsp; I will use this as an opportunity to explain that PBMining does not stop adding mined Bitcoins to your accounts during server downtime!&nbsp; They have told me that they should be back up in 15-20 minutes.&nbsp; I apologize to anyone who loves to watch their hash power like a hawk.&nbsp; ;)
